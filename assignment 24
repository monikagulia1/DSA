💡 1. Roman to Integer

Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M.

SymbolValue
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000
For example, 2 is written as II in Roman numeral, just two ones added together. 12 is written as XII, which is simply X + II. The number 27 is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the number four is written as IV. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as IX. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9.
X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90.
C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.
Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.

def roman_to_int(s):
    roman_values = {
        'I': 1,
        'V': 5,
        'X': 10,
        'L': 50,
        'C': 100,
        'D': 500,
        'M': 1000
    }
    total = 0
    i = 0

    while i < len(s):
        if i + 1 < len(s) and roman_values[s[i]] < roman_values[s[i + 1]]:
            total += roman_values[s[i + 1]] - roman_values[s[i]]
            i += 2
        else:
            total += roman_values[s[i]]
            i += 1

    return total
print(roman_to_int('III'))  # Output: 3
print(roman_to_int('IV'))   # Output: 4
print(roman_to_int('IX'))   # Output: 9
print(roman_to_int('LVIII'))  # Output: 58
print(roman_to_int('MCMXCIV'))  # Output: 1994

1994
 
💡 2. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

Example 1:

Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
Example 2:

Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
Example 3:

Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
Constraints:

0 <= s.length <= 50000
s consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.
def length_of_longest_substring(s):
    start = 0
    end = 0
    max_length = 0
    seen = set()

    while end < len(s):
        if s[end] not in seen:
            seen.add(s[end])
            end += 1
            max_length = max(max_length, end - start)
        else:
            seen.remove(s[start])
            start += 1

    return max_length
print(length_of_longest_substring("abcabcbb"))  # Output: 3
3
💡 3. Majority Element

Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element.

The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,2,3]
Output: 3
Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]
Output: 2
Constraints:

n == nums.length
1 <= n <= 5 * 10^4
-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
def majority_element(nums):
    majority = nums[0]
    count = 1

    for i in range(1, len(nums)):
        if nums[i] == majority:
            count += 1
        else:
            count -= 1

            if count == 0:
                majority = nums[i]
                count = 1

    return majority
print(majority_element([3, 2, 3]))  # Output: 3
3
💡 4. Group Anagram

Given an array of strings strs, group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in any order.

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

Example 1:

Input: strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]
Output: [["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]
Example 2:

Input: strs = [""]
Output: [[""]]
Example 3:

Input: strs = ["a"]
Output: [["a"]]
Constraints:

1 <= strs.length <= 10000
0 <= strs[i].length <= 100
strs[i] consists of lowercase English letters.
from collections import defaultdict

def group_anagrams(strs):
    anagram_groups = defaultdict(list)

    for word in strs:
        sorted_word = ''.join(sorted(word))
        anagram_groups[sorted_word].append(word)

    return list(anagram_groups.values())
strs = ["eat", "tea", "tan", "ate", "nat", "bat"]
print(group_anagrams(strs))
# Output: [["eat", "tea", "ate"], ["tan", "nat"], ["bat"]]
[['eat', 'tea', 'ate'], ['tan', 'nat'], ['bat']]
💡 5. Ugly Numbers

An ugly number is a positive integer whose prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5.

Given an integer n, return the nth *ugly number*.

Example 1:

Input: n = 10
Output: 12
Explanation: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12] is the sequence of the first 10 ugly numbers.
Example 2:

Input: n = 1
Output: 1
Explanation: 1 has no prime factors, therefore all of its prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5.
Constraints:

1 <= n <= 1690
def nth_ugly_number(n):
    ugly = [0] * n
    ugly[0] = 1
    p2 = p3 = p5 = 0

    for i in range(1, n):
        next_ugly = min(ugly[p2] * 2, ugly[p3] * 3, ugly[p5] * 5)
        ugly[i] = next_ugly

        if next_ugly == ugly[p2] * 2:
            p2 += 1
        if next_ugly == ugly[p3] * 3:
            p3 += 1
        if next_ugly == ugly[p5] * 5:
            p5 += 1

    return ugly[n - 1]
print(nth_ugly_number(10))  # Output: 12
12
💡 6. Top K Frequent Words

Given an array of strings words and an integer k, return the k most frequent strings.

Return the answer sorted by the frequency from highest to lowest. Sort the words with the same frequency by their lexicographical order.

Example 1:

Input: words = ["i","love","leetcode","i","love","coding"], k = 2
Output: ["i","love"]
Explanation: "i" and "love" are the two most frequent words.
Note that "i" comes before "love" due to a lower alphabetical order.
Example 2:

Input: words = ["the","day","is","sunny","the","the","the","sunny","is","is"], k = 4
Output: ["the","is","sunny","day"]
Explanation: "the", "is", "sunny" and "day" are the four most frequent words, with the number of occurrence being 4, 3, 2 and 1 respectively.
Constraints:

1 <= words.length <= 500
1 <= words[i].length <= 10
words[i] consists of lowercase English letters.
k is in the range [1, The number of **unique** words[i]]
from collections import defaultdict

def top_k_frequent_words(words, k):
    word_count = defaultdict(int)

    for word in words:
        word_count[word] += 1

    frequency_words = [(word, count) for word, count in word_count.items()]

    # Sort the words by frequency (in descending order) and lexicographically
    frequency_words.sort(key=lambda x: (-x[1], x[0]))

    # Extract the top k words
    result = [word for word, _ in frequency_words[:k]]

    return result
words = ["the", "day", "is", "sunny", "the", "the", "the", "sunny", "is", "is"]
k = 2
print(top_k_frequent_words(words, k))
# Output: ["the", "is"]
['the', 'is']
💡 7. **Sliding Window Maximum**
You are given an array of integers nums, there is a sliding window of size k which is moving from the very left of the array to the very right. You can only see the k numbers in the window. Each time the sliding window moves right by one position.

Return the max sliding window.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,3,-1,-3,5,3,6,7], k = 3
Output: [3,3,5,5,6,7]
Explanation:
Window position                Max
---------------               -----
[1  3  -1] -3  5  3  6 7         3
 1 [3  -1  -3] 5  3  6 7         3
 1  3 [-1  -3  5] 3  6 7         5
 1  3  -1 [-3  5  3] 6 7         5
 1  3  -1  -3 [5  3  6]7         6
 1  3  -1  -3  5 [3  6  7]       7
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1], k = 1
Output: [1]
Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 100000
-10000 <= nums[i] <= 10000
1 <= k <= nums.length
from collections import deque

def max_sliding_window(nums, k):
    window = deque()
    result = []

    for i in range(len(nums)):
        # Remove indices from the front of the deque that are outside the current sliding window
        while window and window[0] <= i - k:
            window.popleft()

        # Remove indices from the back of the deque that correspond to elements smaller than the current element
        while window and nums[window[-1]] < nums[i]:
            window.pop()

        # Append the current index to the back of the deque
        window.append(i)

        # If the window has reached the minimum size, append the maximum element to the result
        if i >= k - 1:
            result.append(nums[window[0]])

    return result
nums = [1, 3, -1, -3, 5, 3, 6, 7]
k = 3
print(max_sliding_window(nums, k))
# Output: [3, 3, 5, 5, 6, 7]
[3, 3, 5, 5, 6, 7]
💡 8. Find K Closest Elements

Given a sorted integer array arr, two integers k and x, return the k closest integers to x in the array. The result should also be sorted in ascending order.

An integer a is closer to x than an integer b if:

|a - x| < |b - x|, or
|a - x| == |b - x| and a < b
Example 1:

Input: arr = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 4, x = 3
Output: [1,2,3,4]
Example 2:

Input: arr = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 4, x = -1
Output: [1,2,3,4]
Constraints:

1 <= k <= arr.length
1 <= arr.length <= 10000
arr is sorted in ascending order.
-10000 <= arr[i], x <= 10000
def find_closest_elements(arr, k, x):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1

    while right - left + 1 > k:
        if abs(arr[left] - x) > abs(arr[right] - x):
            left += 1
        else:
            right -= 1

    return arr[left:right+1]
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
k = 4
x = 3
print(find_closest_elements(arr, k, x))
# Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]
[1, 2, 3, 4]
